            When you invest in a PEIN Loan Note offering, you are investing in a promissory note in which the investor(Lender) receives a stated interest rate for a stated term that payment of loan between Lender (Investors) and the Borrower (PEIN). The Loan Note is a contract between the investor and PEIN. Although the investor does not own any equity in the property and name is not on the property title, the Loan Note Certificate gives the investor an interest—shared with the other investors who have funded the project—in the underlying property. The interest in the property is the right to receive interest distributions as well as the return of principal.

        Good question. It’s happened to investors and savers before when companies have folded and investor’s money has disappeared. And no doubt it will happen again with some unscrupulous companies. The reason we will never do that is we can’t – even if we were so minded (which, for the record, we are not). <br><br>Our business models guarantees investors return and a very healthy returns for us. 
We are real estate developers and we don’t believe in fast money schemes

        Since our loans Notes are for short-term real estate development projects, they generally carry higher interest rates than Savings or Fixed products offered by Banks. Because each loan is unique, the interest rate is determined based on many factors. Most loans tend to carry an interest rate of 15-35%.

…but, seriously, there could be some unforeseen circumstances in a very rare situation, which could lead to some delays that is structurally absorbed by our funds or some lenders reinvesting or we could sell your loan notes to new lenders.
For example, the property sale could be delayed. <br><br>If that happened, it’s clearly unfortunate, but not a disaster as delay is no denial. We always do have other properties and funds to cover any delay in a sale or resell your loan note to new lender to extend repayment term.
In any event, if that did happen, our formula ensures you are paid as agreed.
